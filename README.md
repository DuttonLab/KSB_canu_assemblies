# Canu assemblies of pacbio sequences for initial 10 genomes

Genomes sequenced:
- JB4
- JB5
- JB7
- JB182
- JB197

When running JB5, it looks like coverage for genomes for which we did a single
multiplex run on is not high enough. In those cases, SPAdes hybrid assembly is
still probably best option.

- Genomes were downloaded [from here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0BxSnFgYDpKq9Y09JZ1lWSVBtSXc).
- Assemblies and files associated with the runs [are here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0BwMisVHziZ0qSXo3WkswN0tPSm8).
- Logs are in this repo in [logs](logs/) directory.
